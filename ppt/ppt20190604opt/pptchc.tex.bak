\begin{frame}{Suspected minimum point}
	
\begin{definition}[Suspected minimum point]
	For a given function $f(x)$ and a search radius
	$\rho$, $\tilde{x}$ is a suspected minimum point (SMP) if $f(\tilde
	x)\leq f(x)$ for $\forall x\in O(\tilde{x},\rho)$.
\end{definition}
where $O(\tilde{x}, \rho)=\{x: |\tilde{x}-x|=\rho\}$.

\begin{itemize}
	\item 
When $\tilde{x}$ is a minimizer in the neighborhood of
$U(\tilde{x}, \rho)$, $\tilde{x}$ is a SMP. 
\item The opposite is not always true. 
%    A sufficient condition is given as follows.
\end{itemize}
%\begin{proposition}
%    Assume that $f(x)$ is continuous differentiable, $\rho < 1$,
%    and $|\nabla f(\tilde x)| < C\rho$, $C$ is related to the
%    Hessian matrix of $f$ on $\tilde{x}$,
%    then SMP $\tilde{x}$ is a minimizer in $U(\tilde{x}, \rho)$.

\begin{frame}{Finite-Step Convergence}

\begin{theorem}[Finite-step convergence]
	Assume that objective function $f(x)$ is continuous and the
	search domain $\Omega$ is a compact set. 
	If there are not two SMPs $x_*$ and $x^*$ such that
	$f(x^*)=f(x_*)=A$ when $|x_*-x^*|=\rho$. 
	Then Algorithm \ref{alg:shc} converges in at most finite steps.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\begin{itemize}
\footnotesize{
	\item The stick hill-climbing method produces $\{x_n,
		f(x_n)\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$.
	\item From assumption, $f(x)$ is bounded, then
		the decreasing sequence $\{f(x_n)\}$ is convergent, i.e.,
		$f(x_n)\rightarrow A$.
	\item The sequence $\{x_n\}$ has a convergent subsequence
		$\{x_{n_k}\}$, i.e., $x_{n_k}\rightarrow x^*$.
	\item There exists a subsequence $\{x_{n_{{m}}}\}$ satisfying
		$|x_{n_k}-x_{n_{m}}|=\rho$. Obviously,
		$f(x_{n_m})\rightarrow A$.
	\item $\{x_{n_{m}}\}$ has a
		convergent subsequence $\{x_{n_{m'}}\}$, s.t.
		$x_{n_{m'}}\rightarrow x_*$.
	\item We have $|x^* - x_*|=\rho$, $f(x^*)=f(x_*)=A$.
